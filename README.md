# Analog Clock Project

Welcome to the Analog Clock project! ðŸ•’

## What's This Project About?

This project is all about making a cool analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You know, like the classic clocks with the hour, minute, and second hands!

## What Does It Do?

This clock we're making will show the current time just like a real clock does. It's going to be on a web page and will have those moving clock hands that show the hours, minutes, and seconds.

## How to Use It?

Follow these steps:

1. **Get the Code**: Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to get all the project files. Or, if you're familiar with Git, use `git clone` to download the files.
2. **Open the Clock**: Find and open the file named `index.html` in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

That's it! You'll see the clock showing the current time once you open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Want to Change or Add Something?

If you want to make the clock look different or add new features, here's how you can do it:

1. **Make Changes**: You can modify the code in the files using a code editor.
2. **Share Your Ideas**: If you have a cool idea, you can suggest it by forking this project and then making a "pull request" with your changes.

## Is It Free to Use?

Yes, it's absolutely free! This project is licensed under the MIT License. Check out the `LICENSE` file for more details.
